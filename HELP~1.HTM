			You can use keyword fragments to search as well. For instance, using <b>ax</b> as

			entering <b>678</b> in the <b>phone</b> field will pull up all ad listings where 
			678 is somewhere in the phone number. This can be useful if you can't quite 
			remember a person's phone number. Other search tricks include: entering <b>.org</b> 
			under <b>email</b> will return ads from members whose email indicates they're a 
			non-profit group. In the next section you'll learn of a trick to find all product 
			websites, and how to use the LETS webtool to promote your site.

			<br>
			As we saw above, some keyword tricks can be used to create lists of matching ads. 
			The same technique can be applied to find product websites. For instance, by using
			the keyword <b>http</b> under the <b>URL</b> field, you'll generate a list of all
			goods and services that also have webpages associated with them. Typically this is 
			a website describing the product or service, or it could be a personal webpage. 
			When you create your ad listings, you have the option of entering a link this way 
			in the URL field (remember to type the full URL, though - the software won't try and 
			guess that you meant "http://www.somesite.com", if you merely enter "somesite.com"), 
			so that prospective customers that are browsing your online LETS can follow the 
			link from your ad to webpages you've designed, to read more about you, your 
			company, or one of your products. Any text you enter in the URL field is assumed 
			to be a web link, and the software will automatically show it as a clickable link.

			The software is designed to allow many LETS within a region to interact online, 
			providing a wider range of goods and services available to their members 
			(conversely, it also allows members to advertise their services over a wider area).
			If you can't find what you're looking for within your own LETS, you may want to search the 
			ad listings of members in neighbouring towns (note this depends on whether your 
			regional LETS have opted to use the software this way). If your LETS is intertrading 
			regionally, remember to check the upper right-hand corner of each ad listing to see 
			which system the ad was submitted in. In the following example, the user has 
			searched for <b>Computer</b> listings that are <b>Offered</b>. However, they didn't 
			specify any particular LETS, so the search engine automatically searches them all.

			<font face="Verdana" size=-1 color="#666666">
			<br>
			One of the most common tasks you'll perform as a LETS admin (using this online 
			system), is to create your member logins. Without them your members cannot use the 
			system. The process is actually very easy: simply click the <b>Members</b> link 
			(which appears in the menu only for you, since your login has administrative 
			permissions), and you'll see a screen like this:
			<p><img src="images/memberlogins.gif" border=1></p>
			This screen is used for some core administrative functions, including:
				<p>
				<font color="blue"><b>Creating New Member Logins:</b></font>
				<ul>
					When a new member joins your LETS and also has internet access, you can 
					include them in the online system by filling out the <b>Create New 
					Username</b> and <b>Password</b> fields, and then hitting the 
					<b>Update/Create User</b> button, as shown above. (Remember to send them 
					an email informing them of their new login, and the URL of the site!). 
					<p>
					If you try to create a 
					username that already exists, the software will stop you with a 
					<font color="blue"><b>Try Again</b></font>
					message in red, otherwise a successful <font color="blue"><b>Login 
					Created</b></font>
					message. To avoid duplicating an existing login, you 
					can scan the <b>Existing Members</b> drop-down list to see which 
					usernames are already taken. The software needs a unique username 
					for every member, <i>even across different LETS</i> within your intertrading 
					group. For this reason we suggest adding a prefix to your member logins, 
					when you create them - ie. Account 503 becomes "Sydney_503", as a username. 
					This naming practice is only necessary if your LETS intertrades (or will in 
					the future), and its account ID's might overlap with other LETS groups in 
					your region. 
				</ul>
				<font color="blue"><b>Editing Existing Logins</b></font>:
				<ul>
					Select the login you want to edit from <b>Existing Members</b> and hit 
					<b>Inquire</b>. Their permissions, password and username will be retrieved 
					to-screen, ready for you to edit. Typically you would use this feature to 
					restrict their permissions if their membership lapses (ie. remove their 
					permission to Add, Modify or Delete ad listings, until they've paid their 
					member dues), or to change a member's password. A more in-depth discussion 
					of Permissions is found below, in <A HREF="help.htm#permissions"><b>Setting 
					a Member's Permissions</b></a>.

				<br>
				Although the webtool lets your members surf the ad listings online, this 
				doesn't benefit your members who may not have internet access. For that reason 
				we recommend that you download your system's ad listings and publish them also 
				as a paper version, for inclusion in the normal (paper) ad directory that you 
				distribute to your members. As of this writing you can print the web version of 
				your ad directory directly from your browser, using the following steps:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Click <b>Ad Directory</b> if it's not the current database in use (ie. 
						if some other table<br>name is shown in the menu's white square). This 
						loads the ads database.
					</li>
					<li>Click <b>Search</b> to call up the search screen.</li>
					<li>Select your LETS from the <b>System</b> drop-down.</li>
					<li>Select <b>all</b> from the <b>Ad Category</b> drop-down.</li>
					<li>Select <b>all</b> from the <b>Ad Type</b> drop-down.</li>
					<li>
						Leave all other keyword fields blank, except for the sorting options 
						near the bottom of the screen. Here you want to set <b>Hits Per Page</b> 
						to a very high value, like <b>99999</b>. This ensures you'll get every 
						ad from your system returned in the Search Results.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set <b>Sort By</b> to <b>Ad_Category</b>. This will ensure that 
						all the ads appear alphabetically by category name, making it easier for 
						members to lookup services on paper. Unfortunately, the Wanted and 
						Offered ads will appear mixed together within those categories - 
						ultimately I'll fix that!
					</li>
					<li>
						Hit the <b>Search</b> button, and the screen will show the entire web 
						directory for your LETS, sorted by category. To print it, go to your
						web browser's menu and select <b>File</b> and then <b>Print</b> (you 
						may want to choose <b>Page Setup</b> first, to make sure it's set for 
						paper size you're going to use.
					</li>
				</ul>			
				The resulting printed directory is not very customizable -  it looks exactly the 
				way it appears on-screen within your web browser. However, I'll be providing an 
				option to download your system's raw data in a format you can use to import 
				into desktop publishing or database software.

				This screen is available only to LETS admins, for the purpose of polishing the 
				printed output they send to members. Typically a LETS will publish a printed 
				Directory of Goods and Services, as well as Transaction Statements that they 
				provide for members, summarizing their various trading. The <b>Download System 
				Data</b> screen is used to grab the raw data their members have submitted online,
				in a file format that can be readily imported into Word, Wordperfect, Access, 
				Quattro Pro, or any commercially available desktop publishing package. The data
				files you download are text-delimited database files, called <b>ads.zip</b> and 
				<b>trades.zip</b>. They're not really zipfiles (ie. they're not compressed), but 
				that file extension is used to force your browser to initiate the download. Once 
				you have both files, you can simply rename them with a <b>.txt</b> extension, 
				(since they're really just sorted textfiles), after which you can readily import 
				them into whatever publishing software you're using. The most common and easiest 
				use of this data is to simply import it into Access or Quattro Pro - two common 
				database tools, then printing them up using a report template you've 
				pre-designed using those tools. Depending on how many LETS want to go online 
				with the webtool system, I can expand this utility to provide a canned Rich Text 
				Format for the sorted output, essentially a canned and formatted document 
				that's ready to go for printing. This would eliminate any extra steps you'd 
				have to take in formatting the data, since I would essentially automate that 
				for you. Alternatively you can simply print the Directory Listings directly 
				from your browser, using the steps outlined in 
				<a href="help.htm#publishing">Publishing the Ad Directory Listings</a>.

				<b>No.</b> The webtool only handles ads and trades submitted through the web, and 
				won't show any that are submitted through your regular software. And since many 
				LETS members do not have internet access, we recommend printing the web version 
				of your system's ad listings and including it as an insert in your regular paper 
				directory, for the benefit of members who are not web-connected. Note that the 
				webtool currently does not tally account balances, or provide utilities for 
				charging member fees of any kind. At this stage, our honest assessment is that 
				the software can provide a complement to your existing software, but not replace 
				it completely. What it <i>will</i> do is alleviate much of your workload as a 
				LETS admin, since members themselves can manage their own ad listings, relieving 
				you and your staff of having to do that data-entry. It will also eliminate the 
				reliance on voice mail (and having to constantly rewind those messages, to 
				transcribe them for data-entry). The software will also provide up-to-the-minute 
				listings of goods and services, rather than a once-monthly printed directory 
				that gets progressively outdated as you approach month-end.
