		The software is a web application written in 
		Perl CGI, and runs on a standard Unix/Linux 
		system that's running webserver software such 
		as Apache - the majority of commercial servers 
		fit this discription - and also requires Perl 
		5.0 or better installed on the server (also 
		usually always the case). The software can also 
		be run on a Windows 95 or better system running 
		a webserver. The <a href="http://www.sambar.com">Sambar 
		Server</a> can be used to modify the files on a windows computer, 
		in conjunction with <a href="http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl">ActivePerl 
		for Win32</a>. In that case you have to remember 
		to change the first few lines of the <b>webtool.cgi</b> 
		file, before uploading it to your Unix/Linux 
		server. For instance, while working on the software 
		on a Windows machine, the first few lines of 
		<b>webtool.cgi</b> look like this: <br>
		<br>
		<ul>
		  <b> #!c:\Perl\bin\perl.exe<br>
		  $db_use_flock = 0;<br>
		  $db_dir_url = "http://localhost/cgi-bin/newWebtool";<br>
		  </b> 
		</ul>
		<br>
		The first line points to the directory where 
		Perl is installed, while the second turns off 
		file locking, which the Windows environment 
		does not support. The last line points to the 
		URL you use to view the software in a browser 
		for offline development. For installing on a 
		Unix system, however, the first few lines should 
		be changed to: <br>
		<br>
		<ul>
		  <b> #!/usr/bin/perl<br>
		  $db_use_flock = 1;<br>
		  $db_dir_url = "http://yourDomain.com/cgi-bin/yourDirectory";<br>
		  </b> 
		</ul>
		<br>

		Installing on Your Server </font> <br>
		<br>
		<font face="Verdana" color="#666666" size=2> 
		To install the software, you need to find an 
		ISP (or a friend who's already running a Unix/Linux 
		webserver), and tell them you have some CGI 
		scripts you want to install. If you already 
		have web space rented with an ISP, it may not 
		be enough - ISP's generally offer CGI access 
		for a little more money than hosting regular, 
		static webpages (and generally, ISP's offering 
		free web space do not include the ability to 
		run CGI). <br>
		<br>
		The costs for CGI access are still modest, however: 
		usually around $10 / month or less (in U.S. 
		dollars). For instance, the webtool demo was 
		originally hosted on <a href="http://www.megs.com">www.megs.com</a> 
		for $99 U.S. per year, which is about the usual 
		fee. Once you've confirmed with your ISP that 
		the account you've bought with them allows for 
		running CGI scripts, you can take the following 
		steps to install the software: <br>
		<br>
		<b>1)</b> <a href="download.html">Download</a> the software's 
		source files. These files come packaged as a 
		single, zipped-up file. You'll need a utility 
		like <a href="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip</a> 
		to extract all the files, which are shown below. 
		Keep all the files together in a single directory 
		(say, c:\TEMP_webtool). <br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/filelist.gif" align=left> <b>2)</b> 
		You'll need a text editor that can save files 
		in Unix format. I use <a href="http://www.winsite.com/info/pc/win95/misc/pfe101i.zip/">Programmer's 
		File Editor</a>, which is a good free utility. 
		Many HTML editors like Homesite also let you 
		save files in Unix format. <b>Important:</b> 
		the files shown contain the source code for 
		the software. However, remember not to open 
		them using Notepad (or any other text editor 
		that can only save files in Windows format), 
		or you may inadvertently save any changes you 
		make in the wrong file format. When you upload 
		them to a Unix/Linux system, files altered using 
		Notepad will not run. <br>
		<br>
		<b>3)</b> You'll need to download and install 
		an FTP program such as <a href="http://www.ipswitch.com">WS_FTP</a> 
		or <a href="http://www.globalscape.com">Cute 
		FTP</a>. These programs typically come with 
		a 30-day trial period, and are used to upload 
		files to your server. They also perform the 
		crucial step of changing file permissions using 
		the CHMOD command in Unix. You'll need to CHMOD 
		each file you've uploaded (usually you right-click 
		on the file), setting its read/write/execute 
		properties correctly (a table showing the correct 
		values is given later). <br>
		<br>
		<b>4)</b> Using your text editor, open up the 
		<b>webtool.cgi</b> file, and change the following 
		line (which is found near the top): <br>
		<br>
		<center>
		  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$db_dir_url = "http://yourDomain.com/cgi-bin/webtool";<br>
		  </b> 
		</center>
		<br>
		This line needs to be changed to reflect the 
		domain you're running the software in. Save 
		the file in Unix format. <br>
		<br>
		<b>5)</b> To install, first connect to the web, 
		then use your FTP program to login to your webserver 
		(your ISP will have given you the username and 
		password you need to login). Find the <b>cgi-bin</b> 
		directory on your server, and create a subdirectory 
		called <b>webtool</b> under it, and two directories 
		under that, called <b>userSession</b> and <b>images</b>. 
		Upload all the webtool files you previously 
		extracted with your zip utility, into the <b>webtool</b> 
		directory, and all files found in <b>images</b> 
		into the corresponding server directory (the 
		userSession directory should be empty). Finally, 
		right-click on each file, to change the file 
		permissions on each one, according to the following 
		table: 
		<p> 
		<table width=500 align=center border=1>
		  <tr>
			<td><b>webtool.cgi</b></td>
			<td>(755)</td>
			<td>-rwxr-xr-x</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr> 
			<td>files ending in <b>.pl</b> or <b>.cfg</b></td>
			<td>(644)</td>
			<td>-rw-r--r--</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr> 
			<td>files ending in <b>.def .log .db .count</b></td>
			<td>(666)</td>
			<td>-rw-rw-rw-</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>the <b>userSession</b> directory</td>
			<td>(777)</td>
			<td>drwxrwxrwx</td>
		  </tr>
		</table>
		<p></p>
		<br>
		<br>
		Test out your installation by pointing your 
		browser at:<br>
		<br>
		<center>
		  <b>http://yourDomain/cgi-bin/webtool/webtool.cgi</b>
		</center>
		<br>
		You should see the login screen. <br>
