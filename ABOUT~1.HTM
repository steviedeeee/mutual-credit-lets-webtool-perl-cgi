                        <p>iLETS is a gateway to internet-based LETS exchange. 
                          iLETS operates like any LETS and provides services to 
                          LETS systems, allowing them to provide their usual services 
                          to their account-holding members. This involves two 
                          primary activities, the publishing of Notices in a Noticeboard 
                          and the recording of Transactions.</p>
                      </dd>
                      <dt></dt>
                      <dt><b>2. iLETS is Free, Open-Source and Distributed</b></dt>
                      <dd> 
                        <p> iLETS is a free service to the LETS community.</p>
                        <p> It is a software program conceived and designed by 
                          Chris Hohner, and worked on by contributors. </p>
                        <p>The program resides on a server in each country in 
                          which a LETS or Mutual Credit system participates in 
                          the iLETS Network. Local groups open their system in 
                          the country server.</p>
                      </dd>
                      <dt><b>3. iLETS is Designed and Intended to Complement LETS 
                        Services </b></dt>
                      <dd> 
                        <p> iLETS and the LETS Webtool (mother program) are still 
                          in early development stages, and thus offer only basic 
                          services at this time. We require the assistance of 
                          other Perl/HTML programmers to add new features to the 
                          program. </p>
                        <p> For the time being, iLETS offers a Noticeboard and 
                          Transaction service, and thus relieves some of the workload 
                          of LETS systems, while providing a new medium for outreach 
                        </p>

                      <dt><b>4. How It Works</b></dt>
                      <dd> 
                        <p> The <a href="http://help.html">user manual</a> goes 
                          into great detail about the function of the iLETS program.</p>
                        <p> First, server space needs to be located in the country 
                          in which the local system's files will reside. See the 
                          user manual for details</p>
                        <p> The local LETS system's administrator must contact 
                          us or the server administrator in their country about 
                          how to participate in the network.</p>
